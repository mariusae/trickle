.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a userspace bandwidth manager.  Currently, 
.Nm
supports the shaping of any SOCK_STREAM (see
.Xr socket 2 )
connection established via the 
.Xr socket 2
interface.  Furthermore, 
.Nm
will not work with statically linked executables, nor with 
.Xr setuid 2
executables.
.Nm
is highly configurable; download and upload rates can be set
separately, or in an aggregate fashion.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds_imagedir
.It Fl h
Displays help.
.It Fl v
Increases the verbosity level (can be specified multiple times).
.It Fl V
Prints version.
.It Fl s
Runs trickle in standalone mode, independent of 
.Xr trickled 8 .
.It Fl d Ar rate\fR[:\fIschedule\fR]
Limit the download bandwidth consumption to 
.Ar rate
KB/s. Optionally, set a
.Ar schedule
to follow.
.It Fl u Ar rate\fR[:\fIschedule\fR]
Limit the upload bandwidth consumption to 
.Ar rate
KB/s. Optionally, set a
.Ar schedule
to follow.
.It Fl w Ar length
Set peak detection window size to 
.Ar length
KB.  This determines how aggressive 
.Nm
is at eliminating bandwidth consumption peaks.  Lower values will be
more aggressive, but may also result in over shaping.  The default
value (512 KB) is usually sufficient.
.It Fl t Ar seconds
Set smoothing time to
.Ar seconds 
s.  The smoothing time determines with what intervals 
.Nm
will try to let the application transcieve data.  Smaller values will
result in a more continuous (smooth) session, while larger values may
produce bursts in the sending and receiving data.  Smaller values (0.1
- 1 s) are ideal for interactive applications while slightly larger
values (1 - 10 s) are better for applications that need bulk transfer.
.It Fl l Ar length
Set smoothing length to
.Ar length 
KB.  The smoothing length is a fallback of the smoothing time.  If 
.Nm
cannot meet the requested smoothing time, it will instead fall back on
sending 
.Ar length
KB of data.  The default value is 10 KB.
.It Fl n Ar path
Use 
.Xr trickled 8
socket 
.Ar path 
to communicate with 
.Xr trickled 8 .
By default, 
.Ar /tmp/.trickled.sock
is used.
.El
.Ss "Schedules"
Both the
.Ar -u
and
.Ar -d
flags accept one or more optional schedules, specified in the following form:
.Pp
:[\fIdays_of_week\fR][\fIstart_time\fR],[\fIend_time\fR],[\fIrate\fR]
.Pp
.Ar days_of_week
may be any of
.Ar Su M T W Th F Sa
in any order.  If no day is specified, the schedule will apply for all days.
.Pp
.Ar start_time
is the 3-or-4-digit 24-hour local time to begin the new bandwidth schedule.
For example,
.Ar 1234
would mean 12:34 PM.
.Ar 123
would mean 1:23 AM.
.Ar 2345
would mean 11:45 PM.
.Pp
.Ar end_time
is the 3-or-4-digit 24-hour local time to end the bandwidth schedule.
.Pp
.Ar rate
is the bandwidth limit (in KB/s) that is enforced during the specified time.
.Pp
Multiple schedules can be string together on the command line.
If the schedules overlap, the last one takes precident.

.It
10 KB/s download limit between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM all days of the week
.It
10,000 KB/s download limit otherwise
